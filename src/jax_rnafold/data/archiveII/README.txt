This is a set of RNA sequences with known structure, useful for benchmarking structure prediction
 accuracy.

This set of structures was originally constructed in (Mathews et al. 1999), and then expanded for use 
by (Bellaousov and Mathews 2010).  Finally, the set was updated most recently for use by 
(Sloma and Mathews 2016).  

The structures are derived from other databases, and these original sources should be cited for any 
subsequent use.  This database includes small subunit ribosomal RNA (Gutell 1994), large subunit 
ribosomal RNA (Gutell et al. 1993; Schnare et al. 1996), 5S ribosomal RNA 
(Szymanski et al. 1998; Daub et al. 2008), Group I self-splicing introns 
(Waring and Davies 1984; Damberger and Gutell 1994), RNase P RNA (Brown 1998), signal 
recognition particle RNA (Larsen et al. 1998), tRNA (Sprinzl et al. 1998), and tmRNA 
(Zwieb and Wower 2000).
Structures were obtained as follows: structures of small and large subunit ribosomal 
RNAs and group I introns were obtained from RNA STRAND v2.0 (Andronescu et al. 2008). Structures of 
5S ribosomal RNAs were obtained from the 2005 update of the 5S ribosomal RNA Database 
(Szymanski et al. 1998). Vertebrate telomerase RNA secondary structure alignments were obtained from 
the Rfam 9.1 database (Gardner et al. 2009). tmRNA secondary structures were obtained from the 
tmRDB database (Zwieb et al. 2003). Structures with unknown nucleotides were omitted from the full 
list of structures in each database. Small and large subunit rRNA sequences were divided into domains 
of â‰¤700 nt as previously reported (Mathews et al. 1999). For the small and large subunit ribosomal 
RNAs, where manual curation was necessary to break the structures into domains, structures were 
chosen to maximize taxonomic diversity (Mathews et al. 1999).
